# IPL_Player_Dismissal_Prediction

TITLE
Predicting the possibility of a player from the batting team to be dismissed using ball-by-ball action data.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project uses a dataset of ball-by-ball action between 2008-2020 to predict the possibility of a player from the batting team to be dismissed. The aim of the project is to use Machine Learning algorithms to predict the outcome of the match and help teams make informed decisions while strategizing their game plan.

The project includes the following steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data and find insights.
Data cleaning and transformation to prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
Implementation of Machine Learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision tree Classifier and KNN.
Use of Grid Search CV to find the best parameters for the algorithms.
Multiple Linear Regression Model to justify why it is not suitable to use Regression models on a classification dataset.

DATASET
The dataset used in this project is ball-by-ball action data between 2008-2020. The dataset includes various features such as batting team, bowling team, runs scored, wickets taken, etc. The data has been sourced from [source] and has been cleaned and processed for this project.

USAGE
The project also includes a IPL_player_dismissal_prediction.ipynb file which can be opened in Jupyter Notebook to view the code and the outputs.

Credits
The dataset used in this project has been sourced from IPL via Kaggle.
